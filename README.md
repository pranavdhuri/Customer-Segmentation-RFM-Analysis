Performing RFM analysis
Recency - Frequency - Monetary (RFM).
It is an indexing technique that uses past purchase behaviour to segment customers.
An RFM report is a way of segmenting customers using three key metrics:
recency (how long ago their last purchase was),
frequency (how often they purchase), and 
monetary value (how much they spent).

--Checking for how many months the company was operational in each year ?

--What was the best months for sales in a specific year ? How much was earned in that month ?

--Checking what products do they sell in the highest revenue generating month ?

--Getting the second highest revenue generating productline from each country ?
--similarly we can get nth revenue generating productline from each country

--Who is our best customer ?

--Who are our most recent customers ?

--What products are most often sold together ?
